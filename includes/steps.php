        <h1>What are your chances of getting into college?</h1>
        <p>CAP takes the guesswork out of college admissions. Students have<br>

                <h3>The acceptance rate on a schoolâ€™s website is not your chance of getting in</h3>
                <p>Schools calculate acceptance rates by dividing the number of accepted students by the total number that applied. Among all the students who apply, some have a 99% chance of acceptance, while others have less than a 1% chance.</p>

                <h3>There are factors outside your control that have an impact on your chances</h3>
